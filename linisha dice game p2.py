print(""" I will now explain the rules of this fun dice game!
    The points rolled on each playerâ€™s dice are added to their score.
If the total is an even number, and additional 10 points are added to their score.
If the total is an odd number, 5 points are subtracted from their score.
The score of a player cannot go below 0 at any point.
The person with the highest score at the end of the 5 rounds wins.
If both players have the same score at the end of the 5 rounds, they each roll 1 die and whoever gets the highest score wins (this repeats until someone wins).
